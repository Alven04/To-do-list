# Introduction
This project is a result of my journey into learning web development. I wanted to create a simple yet functional to-do list application to practice my JavaScript skills.

# Features
Add tasks to your to-do list.
Mark tasks as completed.
Delete tasks from your to-do list.
Clear all completed tasks with one click.

# Demo
You can view a live demo of the project here.

# Usage
To use the application, simply download or clone the repository and open the index.html file in your web browser. From there, you can start adding, completing, and deleting tasks on your to-do list.

# Future Improvements
While this project currently provides basic functionality, there are several enhancements I plan to add when time permits:

- **Improved Styling**: I plan to enhance the visual appeal of the application by adding CSS to create a more polished and user-friendly interface.
  
- **Additional Features**: I have several ideas for additional features, such as:
  - Prioritizing tasks
  - Adding due dates to tasks
  - Filtering tasks by category
